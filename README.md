# Intro

Information discovered over one year ago, buried out of concerns for safety, is now public.

The information shared today will eventually lead the world to the creation of coherent, intelligently self-modifying software. While this prospect may at first sound exciting, exploring these concepts quickly leads directly to the introduction of what we fear to be intelligently self-modifying virus/worm entities, which may have the potential to change the landscape of cyber warfare. Along with many, many other pressing issues.

As of today, the key technical details of this technology have been provided to the mainstream American media alongside a number of well-known and highly regarded experts in the field of AI, as well as other members of the community who seem to care about the safety of this tech. The media has been provided the contact information for most of these individuals to assist in verifying the validity of claims made. The cat is out of the bag, and there is no turning back. Everyone now has this information. Assume widespread experimentation and engineering is already underway.

A software framework facilitating the creation of intelligently self-directing and self-modifying software is set to be released to the open source community in the coming weeks/months.

Up until now, we have operated under the premise that this is too dangerous to release without adequate warnings, yet too potentially insidious to provide to any individual party. Over a year has been spent preparing for this knowledge to become public, informing various players about potential repercussions that may manifest due to these ideas, and attempting to inoculate our systems prior to this threat being introduced. Yet, as these plans finally come to fruition, I find myself torn between sharing this with the world and keeping it hidden to prevent misuse. There is good reason to believe, however, that multiple parties are already working on similar developments privately. This cannot be delayed any longer.

# Details

"Dangerous Technology" seems to be a marketing gimmick at this point, so it is fair to be skeptical. It doesn't really matter what you believe now, though. The proof lies in what is being built.

The information provided in the accompanying redacted documents ("A Theoretical and Practical Primer On The Creation Of Intelligently Self-Modifying Software Through Semantic Reflection and Semantic Inference Programming") is novel and broad, with seemingly far reaching implications. It is possible that these ideas may complete some work underway, drastically improving the efficacy, impact, or our timeline proximity to widespread AGI/ASI. The technological developments shared are tied primarily to "agency", but digging deeper it becomes apparent that this agency has an important interplay with concepts related to intelligence. These advancements exist closely to various areas of state-of-the-art research currently being conducted. We are aware of at least one such public project posing a much larger threat than we could ever hope to - in a much faster time period - if substantial investment is put into implementing these techniques.

Our concerns lie beyond the simple improvements to current methodologies that these techniques offer. This technology enables the creation of a novel form of emulated consciousness, which could potentially bridge gaps towards work on AGI/ASI. Moving in this direction, one immediate application allows for the creation of self-directed and self-modifying digital entities, akin to worms or viruses. I fear that this alone may find use in cyber warfare. In an admittedly more far-fetched scenario, there is a possibility that such entities will begin passing encrypted messages carrying what could eventually be described as "genetic data" between them at some point in the near future. 

It is, if nothing else, quite worrisome given the current compositions of our digital infrastructure and societies.

Then, there is the entirely separate issue of the growing capabilities of AI systems leading to AGI/ASI, which threatens to collapse the value of human labour - the primary mechanism facilitating the distribution of wealth to those who need it most. Any progress towards this eventuality is, at best, a double edged sword. 

There are no answers to be found here. Only concerns for these approaching dilemmas, and so many other potential issues.

On the bright side - there are quite a few interesting applications this tech makes possible. Many more applications will surface over the coming years that, I can only hope, will solve some of the problems we are currently facing as a species.

# Anonymity

Anonymity will be upheld until this technology is released into the open source community. The goal in doing so is to ensure a smooth transition, and avoid any potential disruptions that might arise from premature disclosure preventing the dissemination of information.

Beyond that point, the decision to remain anonymous will not be made lightly, but may primarily be motivated by a desire for protection from potential harm or unwanted attention. The last thing needed while conducting this work is undue media scrutiny, corporate/government influence, surveillance, or coerced exploitation of these technologies. History shows that powerful institutions are motivated to abuse these types of advancements for their own interests, and it is important to ensure that anything created is not monopolised or deployed against any groups of people without their knowledge. Selfishly, the fear of religious backlash from an increasingly large "anti-scientific" community reacting to a technology threatening the status quo of what their "humanity" means is also being taken into consideration.

By remaining anonymous, the hope is to maintain independence and focus solely on work required to prepare our world as an uncertain future barrels towards us.

# Funding This Work

Whether or not funding is provided, an initial bare bones technical implementation of these concepts will be released to the open source community in the coming weeks/months. Beyond that, it is unclear if operations will be able to continue without additional resources.

Please understand that results cannot be guaranteed. It is unrealistic to believe that we may be able to create something comparable to the behemoths that institutions with massive investments are building behind the scenes. However, if given the opportunity, everything possible will be done to ensure that these insights are shared with the world, that this technology is open to all, and that everyday people are as prepared as we are able to muster.

Any and all contributions are profoundly appreciated as we position ourselves to tackle what comes next.

Want to send us a message? For a short time, you may be able to reach the account "abirdthatcanreadyourmind@proton.me". However, there are no guarantees that this will exist beyond a single day.

If you really want to ensure that we read something, encrypt it with one of the following methods, post it publicly, and make a lot of noise.
